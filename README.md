They've driven me insane... System logs.. Mail Logs.. Why so much text to look through? 
Why so hard sometimes to find that bit of interest? That reason the thing happened?

There are SIEMs and larger systems available to analyze these things on larger scales...
But what of us mere mortals? What chance do we have? What tools? BASH scripts? GREP???

I would say "Join Me", but few would really dive into the logs and come out unchanged..
